# Sprint_4_Project
Web Application called "Charts for Cars", which is brief insight into a car catalog belonging to a used car dealership.

This repository has been built with a web application as it's ultimate goal. 
Files in this repository include the original dataset filename, a Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis on said dataset, a list of required packages, a file setting up streamlit configuration to run the app, and finally, the Python file of the Web Application itself.
This App will include a summary of three important points: Number of Cars, Average Price, and Average Model Year.
The Web Application is simply a brief overview of patterns in the dataset using a couple charts. This also includes a checkbox at the bottom in case the reader decides to see the actual dataset.

Student Comment: Thank you for the review and for pointing out items that need work. I agree with you about the Notebook. I have a knack for going wild with the coding and EDA and completely forgetting to discuss what I'm doing and why. I start to have fun and forget about descriptions. Also, I was having trouble deciding what to put in place of the missing values for Odometer. I put zero, but I feel like that could skew data and create outliers. It's also unreliable data since no used car has 'zero' miles on it. Any thoughts on that? 
Student Comment: Also, can you please walk me through the steps to run this on a local command line? I recognize those steps are probably something that should be on this ReadMe, but I have trouble remembering how to run it locally. Thanks!
