# Sprint_4_Project

This repository has been built with a web application as it's ultimate goal. 
Files in this repository include the original dataset filename, a Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis on said dataset, a list of required packages, a file setting up streamlit configuration to run the app, and finally, the Python file of the Web Application itself.
The Web Application is simply a brief overview of patterns in the dataset using a couple charts. This also includes a checkbox at the bottom in case the reader decides to see the actual dataset.
